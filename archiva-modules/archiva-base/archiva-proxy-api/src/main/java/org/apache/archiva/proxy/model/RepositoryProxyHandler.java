/**
 * A repository proxy handler is used to fetch remote artifacts from different remote repositories.
 * A proxy handler is connected to one managed repository and a list of remote repositories.
 *
 * Repository proxies should not be confused with network proxies. Network are proxies for specific network protocols,
 * like HTTP. A repository proxy delegates the repository requests to remote repositories and caches artifacts.
 *
 * If a artifact is requested for the managed repository and the artifact is not cached locally, the handler goes through
 * the list of remotes and tries to download the artifact. If a download was successful the artifact is cached locally.
 *
 * The connection between managed and remote repositories is defined by list of {@link ProxyConnector} each defines a one-to-one relationship.
 *
 * A proxy connector defines specifics about the download behaviour:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Policies {@link org.apache.archiva.policies.Policy} define the behaviour for different cases (errors, not available, caching lifetime).</li>
 * <li>Black- and Whitelists are used to ban or allow certain paths on the remote repositories.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The policies and black- and whitelist are set on the {@link ProxyConnector}
 *
 * There may be network proxies needed to connect the remote repositories.
